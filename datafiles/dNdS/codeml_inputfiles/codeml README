How to make codeml inputfiles

1. In geneious, concatenate all REF sequences into a single sequence and all MUT sequences into a single sequence. Remove the 3 nucleotides that code for the stop codon at the end of each sequence. Copy the concatenated REF sequence and name the copy the outgroup.

2. Create an alignment of the three sequences (concatenated REF, concatenated MUT, and outgroup). Export the alignment in PHYLIP format. Change the extension ".phy" to ".txt"

3. Create a tree in Geneious of the three sequences. Export the tree in Newick format.

4. Edit your .ctl file so that it lists the correct filenames for you sequence (alignment) and tree files.

5. To run codeml: /Users/eloralopez/Documents/PAML/paml4.8/bin/codeml file.ctl
